# Space Invaders Replica

This is a side project for learning both Python and PyGame, recreating the classic Space Invaders.

Thanks to @rafalagoon for the proyect idea/initiative and some workarounds for "how-to"'s and other problems.

## What did I learn
- Developing a full app on Python :)
- Using a framework for game dev (rather than a full engine p.e. Unity)
  - Better understand the basics of how game engines work
- Working with different environments (sometimes Windows with VScode and others in Ubuntu Budgie with vim)
- How to build an executable Python app with cx_Freeze, and for both Win&Linux
- Scheduling a project with a concrete scope and time bounds, and committing to it
- At the end of the project I realized that hey! Python is OO, maybe I could program like in OOP and not only like plaing scripting! :')

Generaly, looking back at the code I realise how bad it is and how many things could have been done much better, so... yeah, just one of my first projects :)
